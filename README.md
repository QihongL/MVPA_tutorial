MVPA tutorial - Rogers lab brain imaging unit  

I am organizing the brain imaging unit at the <a href = "http://concepts.psych.wisc.edu/" > Knowledge and Concepts Lab</a>, directed by Professor Tim Rogers. This is a tutorial (in progress) that introduces people to MVPA methods. To tackle the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underdetermined_system">underdeterminacy</a> of neuroimaging data without pre-defining ROIs, I will focus on sparse methods, such as Logistic LASSO. 

You can access the <a href = "https://github.com/QihongL/MVPA_tutorial/wiki/0.-Plan">meeting schedule</a> from the wiki page.
