MVPA tutorial - Rogers lab brain imaging unit  

I am organizing the brain imaging unit at the <a href = "http://concepts.psych.wisc.edu/" > Knowledge and Concepts Lab</a>, directed by Professor <a href = "http://concepts.psych.wisc.edu/index.php/tim-rogers/">Tim Rogers</a>. This is a tutorial (in progress) that introduces people to MVPA methods. 

Neuroimaging data analysis is usually <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underdetermined_system">underdetermined</a>. For example, a typical fMRI data might has 100,000 features (voxels) with only a few hunderds of training examples (stimuli presented). To tackle this issue of underdeterminacy while fitting the whole brain model (i.e. without pre-defining ROIs), we tend to use sparse methods, such as the Logistic LASSO, which will be the main focus of this tutorial.
